The course started with an overview of the SAIL field campaign, quickly diving into ways to access the data and analyze the datasets using open-source tools funded and supported by ARM! We also covered advanced data visualization techniques using the Pangeo stack, including using Xarray and the Holoviews tools to visualize an entire day’s worth of high spatiotemporal cloud radar data.","position":{"start":{"line":12,"column":1},"end":{"line":12,"column":1}},"key":"aEcAuysoRS"}],"key":"PX3CAzTPr7"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":14,"column":1},"end":{"line":14,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"My favorite part of the course covering that last section.

One of the more notable moments during the Python symposium was Monday afternoon’s session, where Tom Nicholas (developer of several Pangeo-related packages) asked the room “Who here has used and is familiar with Xarray”? Almost everyone in the room raised their hand. This contrasts with last in-person meeting, the 100th AMS Annual Meeting in Boston, where there were still quite a few people working on adopting Xarray within their workflows. It was also astonishing how many presentations explicitly mentioned their tools are built around Xarray. Another common theme during the Python Symposium was the impact Project Pythia is having on the community, and how many presenters are interested in contributing cookbooks or improving the existing content.","position":{"start":{"line":21,"column":1},"end":{"line":21,"column":1}},"key":"NUlJrUghUN"}],"key":"BAupbqwIU8"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":23,"column":1},"end":{"line":23,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"After each day of sessions, attendees flocked to different social events, with most focused-on alumni or general AMS-hosted networking opportunities.
